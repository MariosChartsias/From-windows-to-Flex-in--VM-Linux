By opening files go anywhere you want to locate the file             (easiest from GUI)
Right-click                                                          (select the option "open in terminal")
type: sudo so                                                        (enter your password if requested)
to unlock a specific file type chmod 777 ./file_name                 (where file_name is the file that you want to unlock)
